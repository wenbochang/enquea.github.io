Greetings,

I'm writing to apply to the Ruby on Rails Engineer position at Zendesk. I am a web developer with experience in Rails and JavaScript.

I'm currently looking for opportunities to join a team that's building an awesome product
and solving hard problems. Zendesk's data driven approach sounds like a great combination of the two.
I would love to connect to talk more about your product and the engineering profile you're looking for.

My resume is attached for your convenience. You can also see my sample projects here:

I look forward to speaking with you.

Best,

Wenbo Chang
